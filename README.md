What is Spring Autowiring?

For dependency injection, Spring can use autowiring. 
Actually, Spring will look up for a class that mathces a given property - matches by type: class or interface.
Once Spring finds a match, it will automatically inject it...hence it is autowired.

Autwiring Injection type:
1) Constructor type
2) Setter injection
3) Field injection
